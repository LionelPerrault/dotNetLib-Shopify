    /// UPDATE October 2022:
    /// This API bug has been encountered in several additional API fields, such as transaction.processed_at, customer.accepts_marketing_updated_at and customer.email_marketing_consent.consent_updated_at
    /// See https://github.com/LionelPerrault/dotNetLib-Shopify/issues/803

    /// *It seems to can start occurring on multiple any date fields
    /// *The impact of not handling is quite severe. ShopifySharp would fail to deserialize and return an error
